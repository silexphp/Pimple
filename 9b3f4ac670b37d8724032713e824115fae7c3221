you should update the Travis config to make it run the PHPUnit testsuite against both the PHP and C implementations (have a look at the Twig repo to see how it is done)

What about updating the travis conf to run the PHPUnit test suite against the extension ?

woops ! I've actually missed comments you wrote here (outside the source code) ^^

@jpauli do we need the phpt testsuite ? It kinds of duplicate the PHPUnit testsuite. Given that the PHP and C implementations should be equivalent, it would make sense to use the same testsuite for both.

Yes we need both tests.
phpt tests are for bugs I track when I develop, I need them.
PHPUnit tests are for API compatibility check

see https://github.com/fabpot/Twig/blob/master/.travis.yml as you need approximately the same config (it simply needs to be adapted for extension names)
