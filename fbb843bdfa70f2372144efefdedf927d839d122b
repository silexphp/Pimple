How to perform tests? Travis does not seem even to be invoked:
- https://github.com/silexphp/Pimple/pull/268/checks

should first try to migrate to GitHub Actions?

---------------------------------------------------------------------------

Yeah, we probably need to migrate to GitHub Actions as Travis stopped providing free CI for open-source packages.

@stof they do provide, but you first need to "migrate" to travis.com:
- https://docs.travis-ci.com/user/migrate/open-source-repository-migration

altho, it may be easier to start from scratch:
- https://www.travis-ci.com/getting-started/

and indeed, last build is 8mo ago:
- https://travis-ci.org/github/silexphp/Pimple/builds/761679114

Ok, the GHA setup was rather trivial (5m work):
- https://github.com/silexphp/Pimple/pull/269

@glensc and once you migrate to travis-ci.com, you don't get free CI for public repositories. You only get something like a free trial.

if in the end pull request is squash merged, what's the point of trying to preserve authorship of commits?

- https://github.com/silexphp/Pimple/pull/269#ref-commit-85cb605

perhaps this and adding test should be then separate Pull Requests?

---------------------------------------------------------------------------

Commits from different authors are not merged.

---------------------------------------------------------------------------

by glensc at 2021-10-27T10:15:34Z

so, the `src` changes should be perhaps reverted? the doc changes are useless and typehint is to be merged via https://github.com/silexphp/Pimple/pull/266?

Example of CI job:
- https://github.com/glensc/php-Pimple/actions/runs/1389643807

The actions are run in my fork only, because not merged to master yet?

---------------------------------------------------------------------------

by stof at 2021-10-27T15:01:10Z

@glensc if you push to that PR again, the CI should now run

---------------------------------------------------------------------------

by glensc at 2021-10-27T16:43:24Z

what about my question:

Removed Draft state. Ready for merge. Is the attribution done correctly?
