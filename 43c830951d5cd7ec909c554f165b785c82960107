Do we need to do the same for Twig?

Twig does not run a phpt testsuite in Travis. It odoes not have it. The Twig extension is tested only through the PHPUnit tests of the library

hmm, looks like it does not work. The exit code is still ``0``.

actually, it works but only on PHP 5.5+. The PHP test runner has a bug in 5.4 and older regarding the exit code reporting
