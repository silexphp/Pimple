I'm :+1: on the general idea, but :-1: on this implementation. I think this would be too restrictive for Pimple's general use. The implementation either needs to freeze individual services, so a service gets frozen once accessed, or allow services to be overwritten (usually use case is extending something), while in a container fetch. I toyed with the idea of the latter in this gist https://gist.github.com/davedevelopment/d4e137e69c8d2e845899

@davedevelopment updated to freeze individual services only.

:+1:

I just ran the test suite of my biggest silex project against this, and apart from a few problems with the dispatcher, which will be solved with the `EventListenerProviderInterface` anyway, everything seemed to work.

I also ran it against the silex 2.0 branch's test suite and the only things that failed where due to the way some tests have been written.

Can you rebase please?

As this is a BC break, it should target the 2.0 branch, not master

The master branch is the 2.0 branch.

nevermind, Pimple does not have a separate branch for 2.0
